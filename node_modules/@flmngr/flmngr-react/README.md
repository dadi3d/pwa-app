Flmngr is a **JavaScript** / **TypeScript** library which lets you upload, manage files, edit images and re-upload them onto your server, and create different image formats (resized variants).

It can be used as a **file manager** when you wish to let the user have a feature just to manage files on the server.

Also, you can use it in **file picker** mode when you need to let the user select some file or image on your server. This is useful for handling **file inputs** and **managing image galleries** (you can pass to the file manager preselected files and retrieve a new set after a user closes the dialog).

Built-in **image editor** gives you a feature to edit images right in the browser.

**Powerful API** is a base for creating very custom scenarios.

Your files are your files, Flmngr does not lock you in a cloud: **PHP**, **Node** and **Java**  backends for your server is available. But when you need [Amazon S3](https://n1ed.com/doc/file-manager-for-amazon-s3) and [Azure Blob](https://n1ed.com/doc/file-manager-for-azure-blob) adapters can be installed.

You can use Flmngr in any application from custom ones (by using this **NPM package**) to **React**, **Vue**, or **any framework** apps. 

Flmngr is so flexible that has integration for popular CMSs like **Drupal** and WYSIWYG editors such as **TinyMCE**, **CKEditor 4**, and **CKEditor 5**.
